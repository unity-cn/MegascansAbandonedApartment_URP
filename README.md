## Goal:

Use this scene to make a HDRP Scene with complete lighting:


1. Physically correct lighting for midday and sunset (two lighting adjustments for the same scene)


2. Adjust the proper materials to the scene props (Use HDRP ShaderGraph)


3. The scene can be either real-time lighting or Baked lightmap


4. Do anything you need in Unity Editor to make the final looks as realistic as possible


## Bonus:

Add Decals feature in the scene

### Note:

<li>There are sample URP ShaderGraph shader for reference, They can be converted to HDRP</li>

<li>Do not use any Real-time Raytracing feature </li>
